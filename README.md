# 🍔 Food Delivery App

An end-to-end food ordering and delivery application, built with a modern DevOps toolchain and cloud-native architecture.

## 🚀 Overview

This project demonstrates how to build, deploy, and manage a full-stack food delivery system using microservices, CI/CD automation, and cloud technologies.

### ✨ Features

- ✅ Designed and implemented an end-to-end food delivery application using **Spring Boot** in a microservices architecture  
- ⚙️ Built a fully automated CI/CD pipeline using **Jenkins** and **ArgoCD**  
- 📦 Containerized all services with **Docker** and deployed to **Kubernetes** for scalability and resilience  
- 🧪 Ensured code quality and test coverage using **JUnit** and **SonarQube**  
- 🛢️ Integrated both **SQL** and **NoSQL** databases to support diverse data requirements  
- ☁️ Deployed the application on **AWS** to gain hands-on experience with cloud provisioning and scalability  
- ☸️ Used **AWS EKS** for Kubernetes-based orchestration and integrated **AWS Load Balancer** for traffic management  
- 🗄️ Managed relational data using **AWS RDS**  
- 🍃 Simplified NoSQL data management with **MongoDB Atlas**
